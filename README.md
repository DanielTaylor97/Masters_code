# Masters_code
Code for the preprocessing of 3D MRI data, creation and training of Age and Masking Regression Networks, the creation of saliency maps and the analysis thereof.

Seperate projects were used for preprocessing, brain age regression networks, the brain masking regression task, and the creation and evaluation of saliency maps. Various files  such as training and test data from the Cam-CAN dataset are refered to in the code and are purposefully not made available here for data privacy reasons.
